## Development Standards

- **Domain-driven organization** — group code by business domain, not technical layer
- **Simplicity first** — write the simplest code that works, avoid over-engineering
- **Clean code** — clear names, small functions, remove unused code and imports
- **Zero tolerance** — fix all TypeScript/build/lint errors before proceeding

## Conventions

- Use absolute imports with `@` alias
- Ignore unreasonable linter errors with a comment (e.g. magic numbers)
- No "Co-Authored-By" lines in commits and PRs
